Abstract
========

A catalog of clean stars and surroundings is required to perform focus and alignment with the AuxTel. This technote is to describe the notebook  that creates catalogue based on queries and selections from the HD catalogue.
It is anticipated that we'll need to add selection criteria at a later date, so we want to be able to rebuild the catalogue when required.
